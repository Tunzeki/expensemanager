# Welcome to Expense Manager

This project was created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a clone of [this demo](https://expensemanager.demo.vaadin.com/), which I have customized as I saw fit.

## Description

You are an employee of a company and you've spent some money doing some company tasks.

The table on the page provides you with the following information:

- the date you spent the money

- what you spent the money on (i.e. Merchant)

- how much was spent

- the status of the expense: whether it's a new one, if you've been reimbursed, or it's in progress

- a comment providing the context in which you made the expense

You can search the table using the form on the left (if you're viewing the application on a large screen)
or in the dropdown when you click on `Filters` to your right, just before the top-level navigation 
(if you're viewing the application on a mobile device).

The beauty of the application is that it updates in real-time in response to your search.

More so, you can sort the table using any of the table headers.

You're also provided with a total amount the company still has to reimburse you 
(calculated by summing expenses with the `New` status).

You can switch the theme to light/dark using the sun/moon FontAwesome icon in the top-level navigation.

In the nearest future, I will provide a description of how I used React components, state, props, context, built-in and custom Hooks, etc. to complete this project.
